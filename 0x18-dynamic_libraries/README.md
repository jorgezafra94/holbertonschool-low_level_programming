first steps with Dynamic libraries

we're are going to solve these tasks:

0- Create the dynamic library libholberton.so containing all the functions listed below
_putchar, _islower, _isalpha, _abs, _isupper, _isdigit, _strlen, _puts,
_strcpy, _atoi, _strcat, _strncat, _strncpy, _strcmp, _memset, _memcpy,
_strchr, _strspn, _strpbrk, _strstr

1- Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

100- I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!
Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python.
See example for more detail.

101- I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers:
9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the
Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it here. Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation:
