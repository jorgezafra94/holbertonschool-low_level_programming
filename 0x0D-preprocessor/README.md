we are going to solve these problems

0- Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

1- Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

2- Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
You are allowed to use the standard library.

3- Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x

4- Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
